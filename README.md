# Cryptometer
A website built using HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, and Flask that **placed 2nd place** for best design in the [TreasureHacks 3.0 Hackathon](https://treasure-hacks-3-0.devpost.com/)

This project uses a webscraper called snscrape to retrieve Tweets relevant to Bitcoin and Ethereum, and completes a sentiment analysis for them. Using the sentiment analysis, it uses a pre-trained linear regression model model from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment) to predict future price trends. For more information about Cryptometer, feel free to watch this [demo](https://youtu.be/aNVU30JnBGY) video.
